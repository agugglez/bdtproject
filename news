    "text": "The Scarlets have appointed Ken Owens as the first players’ representative on their board. It’s an innovative and forward-thinking call from the west Wales region, coming at a time when major decisions affecting players are being made across rugby, with the coronavirus pandemic putting a focus on finances and seeing contracts being renegotiated. The Scarlets also came close to merging with the Ospreys last year, an episode that could have had adverse consequences for some players at both regions. Now the Llanelli-based region have moved to give the players a voice and a vote in the decision-making process. Scarlets executive chairman Simon Muderack explained: “We have always had a strong relationship with our players and having a player as part of our board will only strengthen that bond. “We have a mantra of ‘one team, one club’, and inviting a player to have a say in our decision-making is a big part of that. “Covid has brought the Scarlets even closer together as a family — the region, community, supporters, staff and players. It is important that we maintain transparency and honesty in how we move forward and that there is also a common purpose with everyone sharing the same values. “The players have bought into this and decided that Ken would represent them on the board. He has already attended meetings and will have a vote on behalf of the squad.” Owens, recently appointed the region’s captain for a record-breaking seventh successive season, added: “It is great that the Scarlets have recognised that the players should have a voice and also a vote in the decisions that ultimately affect them. “I am looking forward to working together with the board for the good of the Scarlets and the region.”",

    "title": "Why Are We Not Talking About the Abducted Kaduna School Children?",
    "language": "en",
    "text": "One thing that is getting increasingly common is the desensitization of many Nigerians to the anomalies happening in the country. We seem to have gotten to a point where we do not care what happens to the country or the people in it. There is an emotional disconnection between Nigerians and Nigeria, a morbid distrust for the government, and a disinterest in the affairs of the state. It has gotten to that stage where we do not care what happens in or to the country, even when final year students of Prince Academy in Damba-Kasaya community in Chikun LGA, Kaduna were bundled away by gunmen on the 24th of August. So far, Nigerians have made good use of social media to voice out their grievances, kick against unfavourable government policies, speak up against injustices, proffer solutions to societal problems, and raise help for many underprivileged people. Nigerians are known to use their voices when terrible policies are made, this is reflected in the suspension of the social media bill and the RUGA settlement project. They are known to use their voices when government officials err, like in the case of Senator Elisha Abbo. They are known to request for justice using hashtags, like in the case of the call for justice for Uwa, Tina, Jennifer, and others. It is, thus, shocking that when these JSS 3 school children were abducted as they prepared for their exams, very few people raised an eye brow, there were no hashtags to demand for their release and the news seem to fade as soon as it was reported. There was no press conference made, no acknowledgment by government officials, no statement from the president, and no word from the governor of Kaduna state. One would begin to wonder if the lives of people, especially Nigerian children, have been relegated to nothing. Or if the lives of Nigerians have become so cheap that gunmen can easily bundle human beings away, like sheep, and the world will move on like nothing has happened. In 2014, at least 276 girls were taken from a government secondary school in Chibok town by Boko Haram. This abduction was the start of many abductions to come. 6 years after and over 100 of these girls are yet to be rescued. In February 2018, over 100 girls were kidnapped from a secondary school in Dapchi, Yobe state. Although they have been released,Leah Sharibu, who was not released for allegedly refusing to convert to Islam, is still being held captive. This is 2020 and we are still having this same issue of abduction and kidnappings. In fact, kidnapping has become a lucrative business for bandit, gunmen, and criminals. In all of Africa, Nigeria has the highest rate of kidnaps for ransom of both locals and foreigners. Nigerians have raised these issues several times on social media. There have been many tweets about the spate of kidnapping on our highways and many people have been scared to embark on inter-state travels. Through the years, abductions and kidnappings have become common, unfortunately, there seems to be no tangible action taken by the government to curb this. Worse still, many Nigerians are beginning to treat the news of people being abducted and forced to pay a huge ransom as normal. When the Chibok girls were abducted, we had the Bring Back Our Girls movement. The same when the Dapchi girls were abducted. 6 years after the abduction of the Chibok girls, women are still clamoring for their release. Today, school children are being abducted and no one seems to care anymore. Nigerians are tired of everything. They are tired of their government. Hashtags today, hashtags tomrrow. Kidnapping today, abductions tomorrow. Bad news everyday and it seems nothing is changing for the better. Nigerians are tired of Nigeria sef! Still, we need to realise that closing our mouths, unlooking the many evils happening in our society, desensitizing ourselves to the happenings of the country, and being nonchalant towards public policies will not solve the problem. We need to speak up. Today. Tomorrow. Everyday. You cannot afford to keep quiet, appropriate blame or become tribalistic in the face of injustice. Shebi it is you people that voted Buhari. E no concern me as long as e no reach my side, make them just dey kidnap deirsef. All these Northen people sef, nawa. Guy, forget, one day e fit reach ya side. Everything that happens in Nigeria, whether in the East, North, South, or West, concerns you. You cannot afford to remain oblivious to the sufferings of other people because, according to you, it doesn’t affect you. Today, they are kidnapping students in their schools, if care is not taken and this is not curbed, kidnappers will be bold enough to knock on doors and kidnap people – right in their homes. Yes, you are tired. But you need to remember that just like you, the innocent people who were kidnapped are human beings who had dreams and plans before the abduction. The Chibok girls in custody, Leah Sharibu, and this newly abducted school children had dreams and hope before they were carted away. Before you politicize this issue, remember that these school children did not vote for Buhari. Before you make it a tribal issue, remember that they did not choose to be born as Northerners. We do not determine our tribe or ethnicity. Children have the right to be safe in their country and it is unfortunate that they have found themselves in a country where human lives have been made cheap. This is not a Southern or Northern problem. This is a Nigerian problem. We need to speak up against abduction and kidnapping in Nigeria. Failure to do this means we can all, one day, be bundled away and the world would move on as though nothing grave happened.",

    "language": "en",
    "text": "WARSAW, Poland — Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz said he had obtained legal advice about being barred from reentering Belarus and counted on Vatican help in correcting the illegal action against him. Kondrusiewicz told Polish Radio in Bialystok Sept. 2 that he had often traveled abroad, with required permits, from his Minsk-Mohilev Archdiocese to attend religious events and conferences and had always been allowed back. The church leader said Belarusian law “stated clearly” that a citizen could not be barred from entering his own country, but added that he had received no reply when he wrote Sept. 1 to the border service in Minsk, quoting the law and requesting an explanation. “The problem lies not just in my exclusion, but also in the fact I’m now unable to attend my schedule of services — people are naturally asking how this could have happened,” he said. A source from the Vatican nunciature in Minsk told Catholic News Service Sept. 3 that the arrival of a new nuncio, Archbishop Ante Jozic, appointed in 2019, had been delayed by the coronavirus, ruling out any official statement on Kondrusiewicz’s plight. “We’re not necessarily expecting the Vatican to say something, but we are expecting it to do something,” the source said. “As yet, nothing is clear, and we are waiting to see what happens. But we obviously hope the archbishop will be back in his diocese soon.” Belarusian bishops also criticized the action against Kondrusiewicz. “These and similar actions by individual authorities do not contribute to building constructive relations between the state and Catholic Church, nor serve to relieve tensions and overcoming the deep divisions in society,” they said in a Sept. 2 statement. Archbishop Kondrusiewicz, a Belarusian citizen appointed to Minsk in 2007 after serving as a bishop in Russia, was barred from crossing the border the day after his pastoral letter was read at churches. The letter warned of civil war, as security forces confronted demonstrators protesting the declared Aug. 9 election of President Alexander Lukashenko. The announcement of the election results led to massive street protests in multiple cities. Church leaders confirmed Catholic clergy and laypeople had been beaten and jailed during the protests. On Aug. 26, police dispersed protesters in Minsk’s Independence Square, and about 100 of them took refuge in nearby Sts. Simon and Helena Church. Police blockaded the entrances for several hours and, after opening the doors, arrested several people who left the church. Father Vladislav Zavalniuk, parish rector, reported the church’s locks had been changed by overnight assailants Sept. 1. The Belarus church’s website said Sts. Simon and Helena would be the site of a Sept. 5 Mass for “those killed and imprisoned during peaceful rallies.”",

    "text": "You’re sitting at your PC, at home, working remotely. You’ve got a partner who is doing the same. Without requiring you to even turn around, an LED display visible to anyone near you lights up an emoji: a stop sign. Now your household knows you’re busy for the moment, without you having to say a word. This is one of many uses for Expressive Pixels, a Windows 10 authoring platform focused on animated visualizations now available for free in the Microsoft Store. In addition to the app, it has a common set of maker firmware source code that enables users with an LED display device to communicate using visuals or emoji. Taken altogether, it can expand non-verbal communication, drive creative applications for developers to use via open source APIs and lower the barrier to entry for aspiring programmers, designers and researchers. Expressive Pixels also acts as a springboard for amateur makers or more computer savvy programmers, allowing them to build new creations without having to figure out how to consume and program animations and images on small devices, by providing a library that does the animation. No matter where you are working, learning or connecting, Expressive Pixels delivers an animated way to personalize your space and augment your presence, in the same way pictures and knickknacks do. “We focus so much on basic day to day functions, but if you look at what makes us human, there are emotions. We want to express and connect with each other,” says Bernice You, a general manager of strategy and projects in Small, Medium & Corporate Business at Microsoft who is on the Expressive Pixels project team and also instrumental in the release of the Eyes First games in 2019, which incorporate Windows 10 Eye Control, a key accessibility feature for people with speech and mobility disabilities. “Being productive is great, but we want to be humans too. It’s quite an untouched space.” The Expressive Pixels project incorporates years of a deep and meaningful collaboration between the Enable Group at Microsoft and people with severe speech and mobility disabilities to try to understand their perspectives, needs and problems as they pertain to communication, creative expression, identity, and human connection with a focus on augmenting traditional AAC devices with novel experiences that serve as proxies for non-verbal communication, personal and creative expression, social cues and device status.",

The announcement of the company’s new investments comes as other companies scale down on operations and investments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is further proof of the Lagos Government’s commitment to ensuring the state’s viability as the number one destination for Foreign Direct Investment in Africa, and will further increase the over 200 jobs created by JCDecaux Grace Lake in the state. The LATIS project delivers a solution that gives citizens real-time information on traffic, through digital traffic arches at key junctions across Lagos. The data collated from the LATIS system has proved extremely valuable to the Lagos government, which continues to show support for the JCDecaux Grace Lake business whilst ensuring that multinational organizations are able to thrive and bring in much needed FDI. The Country Manager for JCDecaux Grace Lake, Dele Odugbemi, said: “The impact of COVID-19 on the global economy has been tremendous and we have seen the shattering of business across the world, in major and developing economies alike.

    "title": "Political ads don’t really persuade voters",
    "language": "en",
    "text": "Regardless of content, context, or audience, political ads do little to persuade voters, according to a new study. The study in the journal Science Advances measured the persuasive effects of 49 high-profile advertisements from the 2016 presidential campaign on a nationally representative sample of 34,000 people through a series of 59 randomized experiments. Expanding on prior research suggesting that political ads have little impact on voters’ preferences, the study shows that those weak effects are consistent irrespective of a number of factors, including an ad’s tone, timing, and its audience’s partisanship. “There’s an idea that a really good ad, or one delivered in just the right context to a targeted audience, can influence voters, but we found that political ads have consistently small persuasive effects across a range of characteristics,” says coauthor Alexander Coppock, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University. “Positive ads work no better than attack ads. Republicans, Democrats, and independents respond to ads similarly. Ads aired in battleground states aren’t substantially more effective than those broadcast in non-swing states.” The researchers conducted the study throughout the 2016 presidential primaries and general election. Over 29 weeks, the researchers divided a representative sample of Americans into groups at random and assigned them to watch campaign advertisements or a placebo advertisement—a car-insurance commercial—before answering a short survey. The researchers selected ads using real-time, ad-buy data and news coverage of each week’s most important ads. They tested ads attacking or promoting Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as well as commercials concerning primary candidates, such as Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat Bernie Sanders. They analyzed the ads’ effects on survey respondents across several variables, including the candidate, party, or political action committee that sponsored them; whether they were positive or negative in tone; the partisanship of those viewing the ads; the time to Election Day when they aired; whether they were viewed in a battleground state or not; and whether they aired during the primary or general election. They found that, on average and across all variables, the ads moved a candidate’s favorability rating respondents only .05 of a point on the survey’s five-point scale, which is small but statistically significant given the study’s large size, note the researchers. The ads’ effect on whom individuals intended to vote for was smaller still—a statistically insignificant 0.007 of a percentage point. Campaigns should carefully consider efforts to tailor advertisements to specific audiences given that the evidence shows that ads’ persuasive effects vary little from person to person or from commercial to commercial, the researchers conclude. The findings do not demonstrate that political advertising is always ineffective, Coppock says, noting that the study didn’t analyze the influence of an entire advertising campaign. “TV ads help candidates increase their name recognition among the public, which is extremely important,” says Coppock, a resident fellow at Yale’s Institution for Social Policy Studies and the Center for the Study of American Politics. “Moreover, the effects we demonstrated were small but detectable and could make the difference between winning and losing a close election.” Additional coauthors are from the University of California, San Diego, and UCLA. The Andrew F. Carnegie Corporation; UCLA’s Marvin Hoffenberg Chair in American Politics and Public Policy; and JG Geer, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Vanderbilt University, supported the study.

    "text": "This content was published on September 3, 2020 - 14:44 By Gopal Sharma KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Police in Nepal used tear gas and water cannon on Thursday to break up a religious rally that defied a government ban on public gatherings imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the ban, about 2,000 residents poured into a major thoroughfare of Lalitpur, near Nepal's capital Kathmandu, to pull a chariot of the rain god, Rato Machhindranath, a ritual that has been celebrated for countless generations. Authorities imposed temporary curbs in Kathmandu and surrounding areas in August to help contain coronavirus contagion and asked residents to observe festivals at home. \"We charged (with) water cannon and tear gas to stop the rally,\" police official Tek Prasad Rai told Reuters. On Thursday, Nepali Health Ministry spokesman Jageshwor Gautam said the number of coronavirus infections in the Himalayan nation had increased to 42,877, with 257 deaths. Temple-studded Kathmandu Valley recorded 445 new cases, a jump of about 7% from the previous day. Witnesses said the protesters, wearing protective face masks agains the virus, threw rocks at baton-wielding police and set a police motorcycle on fire. An injured person was carried away by police, they said. Narayan Prasad Bhatta, the top civil servant of Lalitpur district, said the rally like all other religious and social gatherings had been banned to stem the spread of the pandemic. But participants said they must be allowed to carry on with the rain god tradition that had been celebrated for centuries. Some participants carried placards reading: \"We oppose efforts by the administration to interfere in our culture and festivals.\" (Reporting by Gopal Sharma; Editing by Mayank Bhardwaj and Mark Heinrich)",

    "title": "Trump encourages supporters to try to vote twice, sparking uproar",
    "language": "en",
    "text": "This content was published on September 3, 2020 - 18:12 By James Oliphant WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has urged residents in the critical political battleground of North Carolina to try to vote twice in the Nov. 3 election, once by mail and once in person, causing a furor for appearing to urge a potential act of voter fraud. \"Let them send it in and let them go vote,\" Trump said in an interview on Wednesday with WECT-TV in Wilmington, North Carolina. \"And if the system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won't be able to vote\" in person. Trump has repeatedly asserted, without evidence, that mail-in voting - expanded by some states because of the coronavirus pandemic - would increase fraud and disrupt the November election, although experts say voter fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the United States. Voting more than once in an election is illegal and in some states, including North Carolina, it is a felony not only to vote more than once but also to induce another to do so. Ballots are due to be mailed in North Carolina on Friday. The state's Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that Trump, a Republican, had \"outrageously encouraged\" North Carolinians \"to break the law in order to help him sow chaos in our election.\" Stein wrote: \"Make sure you vote, but do NOT vote twice! I will do everything in my power to make sure the will of the people is upheld in November.\" Trump's campaign and the White House later denied that he meant to tell people to vote twice. \"The president is not suggesting anyone do anything unlawful,\" White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News Channel on Thursday. \"What he said very clearly there is make sure your vote is tabulated and if it is not, then vote.\" In a series of tweets on Thursday morning, Trump again urged his supporters to vote early by mail and then follow up by attempting to vote in person, however. \"On Election Day, or Early Voting go to your Polling Place to see whether or not your Mail In Vote has been Tabulated (Counted),\" Trump wrote. \"If it has you will not be able to Vote & the Mail In System worked properly. If it has not been Counted, VOTE.\" VOTING TWICE 'A FELONY' The Democratic National Committee accused Trump of encouraging voter fraud and said the president was undermining confidence in the fairness of the election. \"Let’s be clear: Voting by mail is a safe and secure way for Americans to participate in our democracy — and Trump should be working to make it easier to vote, not harder,\" Reyna Walters-Morgan, the DNC's director of voter protection, said in a statement. Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for North Carolina’s state Board of Elections, said a person would not be able to cast two ballots, regardless of if they voted by mail or in-person first. The first vote that is received and processed is the one that counts, he said. “Voting twice in an election is a felony,” Gannon said. “If you put a ballot in the mail, and it hasn’t arrived yet, and then you vote in-person before your absentee ballot has arrived, your in-person vote will count.\" He said if an absentee ballot showed up after a person had voted in-person, it would not be counted. Many Americans vote by mail because they cannot make it to the polls in person. Nearly one in four voters cast presidential ballots by mail in 2016. The coronavirus pandemic is expected to result in a record number of mail-in ballots this year as voters seek to avoid the risk of infection. Experts have cautioned the expected surge means a winner may not be clear on election night given the time it will take to count and verify all the ballots. Trump campaigned on Wednesday in North Carolina, known as a battleground state because its population can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections. National opinion polls show Trump, 74, trailing his Democratic rival Joe Biden, 77, the vice president under then-President Barack Obama. Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to suppress the vote to help their side.

    "text": "This content was published on September 3, 2020 - 17:58 BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese rescue workers detected signs of life on Thursday in the rubble of a building in a residential area of Beirut that had collapsed after a huge Aug. 4 explosion at the nearby port, a rescue worker said. He was speaking after the state news agency reported a team with a rescue dog had detected movement under a destroyed building in the Gemmayze area of Beirut, one of the worst hit by the blast. \"These (signs of breathing and pulse) along with the temperature sensor means there is a possibility of life,\" rescue worker Eddy Bitar told reporters at the scene. Rescue workers in bright jackets clambered over the building that had collapsed in the blast, which killed about 190 people and injured 6,000 others. The rescue team were setting up flood lights at the site as the sun set. One rescue worker carried a rescue dog onto the mound of smashed masonry. Bitar said a civil defence unit had been called in to help with extra equipment to conduct the search. Local media said any search and rescue effort, if it became clear that someone was still alive, was likely to take hours.
